  <h1>Punchmilk</h1>
  <p>✦ Hello! I'm @punchmilk_ and I'm a tattoo artist based in Barcelona and for the last 3 years I have developed my style with inspiration in dreamy motives of stars, animals, butterflies, flowers and abstract lines that follow the body composition. I love to mix different textures of blackwork, linework and dots to make certain elements pop out. I have a nice variety of designs that can be suitable for someone who wants a little sticker tattoo or someone who wants a bigger project. I also love to design for people something that we both find a beautiful idea.
You can message me to book or just to ask any info about me and my tattoos.  💜</p>
